# React, Redux, React-Router

### This is simply practice for me and hopefully someone will find it useful for when they're first getting started with React.

## What does this react app do?
- Calls NASA's Picture of the Day API and displays the day's image (some are amazing).

- Calls MovieDB API to get any movies with the word 'NASA' in the title.

- Clicking on any of the movie posters will render high level movie details for now

## What's next?
- Style movie details to make it not look like crap

- Show where the movies are streaming
